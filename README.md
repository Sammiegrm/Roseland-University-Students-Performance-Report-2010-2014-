I recently explored an insightful performance dashboard analyzing Roseland University students across several key metrics from 2010 to 2014. Here's a quick summary of the findings:

🔍 Key Insights:
🎓 Best Graduating Year: 2011 – highest performance and CGPA average.

🧠 Smartest & Most Influential City: Chicago – produced the most brilliant students and had the highest performance influence.

👩‍🎓 Top Performing Gender: Female – significantly outperforming male students.

🥇 Overall Brilliant Student: Alice – with an exceptional CGPA of 4.99.

📈 CGPA Trend: A steady decline from 27.63% (2011) to 10.79% (2010) indicates a need for performance revival.

🏙️ Top Cities: Chicago, Miami, and Atlanta led with the highest number of top-performing students.

🧬 Best Performing Department (100L): ICE (163 students).

✅ Recommendations:
1. Reinvest in academic strategies used in 2011 to reverse the downward CGPA trend.
2. Leverage successful practices from ICE department across other faculties.
3. Promote mentorship and leadership opportunities for female students to build on existing strengths.
4. Analyze teaching approaches in Chicago and Miami for replication across underperforming regions.
